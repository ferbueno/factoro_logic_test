In this test, you'll need to prove your problem solving skills worth. 

The repo contains a spec file, which will test your code against the expected result.

Remember to create your branch and upload your results there. Do **NOT** upload directly to `master`.

## Test your logic

If you want to test your logic against the automatic test, install all dependencies with
```
npm install
```

Then run the test suite
```
npm test
```

Good luck! :D
